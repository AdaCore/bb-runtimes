   --  to nanoseconds.

   TSC_Frequency : constant := 0;
   --  The frequency of the Time Stamp Clock (TSC) in Hertz. When set to zero
   --  the runtime will attempt to determine its value from the processor's
   --  internal registers following the guidelines provided by the Intel 64 and
   --  IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 3B, Section
   --  18.7.3. Since the TSC clock source is implemented differently across
   --  the different Intel chip families, on some certain processors the
   --  runtime may fail to either determine the TSC frequency or will set it
   --  incorrectly. In the former case the runtime will raise a Program_Error
   --  on boot, while for the latter always check to ensure the timing
   --  behaviour is as expected. In both cases you will need to manual set the
   --  TSC_Frequency constant above.

   APIC_Timer_Divider : constant := 16;
   --  Since the timer frequency is typically in GHz, clock the timer down as
   --  we do not need such a fine grain timer capable of firing every
   --  nanosecond (which also means the longest delay we can have before
   --  having to reset the 32-bit timer is ~ 1 second). Instead we aim for
   --  microsecond granularity.

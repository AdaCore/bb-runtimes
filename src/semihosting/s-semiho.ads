--  Semihosting is a mechanism that enables I/O between target and host
--  computer using the debugger. Although based on ARM definition of
--  semihosting, the features described here can be implemented on virtually
--  any platform.

package System.Semihosting is
   pragma No_Elaboration_Code_All;
   pragma Preelaborate;

   procedure Put (Item : Character);
   --  Put a character on the console

   procedure Put (Item : String);
   --  Put a string on the console

   procedure Get (Item : out Character);
   --  Get one character from the console

end System.Semihosting;

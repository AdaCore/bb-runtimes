--  This package defines basic parameters used by the low level tasking system

--  This is the TMS570 (ARMv7) version of this package

   -- Hardware clock --
   --------------------

   --  see system_tms570ls31.c for clock setup

   Clock_Frequency  : constant := 180_000_000;
   --  GCLK clock Hz: used by the Cortex-R cores

   HCLK_Frequency   : constant := Clock_Frequency;
   --  Main clock used by the high-speed system modules
   --  synchronous with system clock

   VCLK_Frequency   : constant := HCLK_Frequency / 2;
   --  used by some system modules, peripheral modules accessed via the
   --  Peripheral Central Resource controller
   --  VCLK: 90 MHz

   Ticks_Per_Second : constant := Clock_Frequency / 8;
   --  RTICLK, with PRE1 used as source, and divider set to 2 ** 3
   --  RTICLK source can come from VCLK, or from the PLL1 with a divider.

   ----------------
   -- Interrupts --
   ----------------

   --  These definitions are in this package in order to isolate target
   --  dependencies.

   subtype Interrupt_Range is Natural range 0 .. 95;
   --  Number of interrupts supported by the VIC. For the TMS570 interrupts,
   --  we really only consider the 95 usable interrupt channels. The run time
   --  assumes the interrupt source to interrupt channel map is direct (1:1),
   --  as is the default, but the user can change this as long as the IRQ used
   --  by the system for alarms stays unchanged.

   Trap_Vectors : constant := 7;
   --  ARM in general has these traps:
   --    0   (at 16#0000#) Reset
   --    1   (at 16#0004#) Undefined Instruction (synchronous)
   --    2   (at 16#0008#) Supervisor Call (synchronous)
   --    3   (at 16#000C#) Abort - Prefetch (synchronous)
   --    4   (at 16#0010#) Abort - Data (asynchronous)
   --    5   (at 16#0014#) IRQ Trap (asynchronous)
   --    6   (at 16#0018#) FIQ Trap (asynchronous)

   Interrupt_Unmask_Priority : constant System.Interrupt_Priority :=
                                 System.Interrupt_Priority'First;
   --  The priority under which we unmask interrupts.
   --  Useful when we use FIQ to simulate priorities on ARM.

   ------------------------
   -- Context Management --
   ------------------------

   --  The run time stores a minimal amount of state in the thread context.
   --  Most state will be saved on the task's stack when calling a potentially
   --  blocking operation, or on the interrupt stack when the task is pre-
   --  empted. Most of the space is currently required for floating point
   --  state, which is saved lazily.

   --  The TMS570 processor needs to save:

   --   * 6 integer registers of 32 bits (r0, r1, PC, CPSR, R12, SP)
   --     for normal processing

   --   * 33 floating point registers of 32 bits (s0 .. s31, FPCSR)

   --  This amounts to 39 registers, rounded up to 40 for alignment.

   Context_Buffer_Capacity : constant := 40;

   ------------
   -- Stacks --
   ------------

   Interrupt_Stack_Size : constant := 4096;  --  bytes
   --  Size of each of the interrupt stacks. Each processor has its own
   --  set of interrupt stacks, one per interrupt priority.

   Interrupt_Sec_Stack_Size : constant := 128;
   --  Size of the secondary stack for interrupt handlers

   ----------
   -- CPUS --
   ----------

   Max_Number_Of_CPUs : constant := 1;
   --  Maximum number of CPUs

   Multiprocessor : constant Boolean := Max_Number_Of_CPUs /= 1;
   --  Are we on a multiprocessor board?

   -- Context Management --
   ------------------------

   --  The run time stores a minimal amount of state in the thread context.
   --  Most state will be saved on the task's stack when calling a potentially
   --  blocking operation, or on the interrupt stack when the task is pre-
   --  empted. Most of the space is currently required for floating point
   --  state, which is saved lazily.

   --  The TMS570 processor needs to save:

   --   * 6 integer registers of 32 bits (r0, r1, PC, CPSR, R12, SP)
   --     for normal processing

   --   * 33 floating point registers of 32 bits (s0 .. s31, FPCSR)

   --  This amounts to 39 registers, rounded up to 40 for alignment.

M68020 Runtimes
===============

This BSP supports the M68020-based Motorola MVME133 VMEmodule as emulated by
GNATemulator.


Runtimes Supported
------------------

* zfp-m68020: ZFP with hard float
* zfp-m68020-softfloat: ZFP with soft float


Floating-Point Support
----------------------

GNAT supports both software and hardware floating-point operations. By default
GNAT uses hard float unless the soft float runtimes are used. The soft float
runtimes are postfixed by -softfloat.

GNAT supports the single, double and extended real data formats offered by the
MC68881 and MC68882 floating-point coprocessors when configure for hard float.
When configured to use soft float, GNAT only supports the IEEE 754 single and
double real data formats. Consequently, the predefine Real types have the
following digits of precision:

+-------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+
| Digits      |  Float  |  Long_Float  |  Long_Long_Float  |
+=============+=========+==============+===================+
| Soft Float  |    6    |      15      |        15         |
+-------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+
| Hard Float  |    6    |      15      |        18         |
+-------------+---------+--------------+-------------------+


Resources Used
--------------

The runtime libraries provide a minimal version of package Ada.Text_IO
supporting character- and string-based input and output routines. These are
implemented using a board-specific UART. You can change the UART selection
as well as the configuration (e.g., the baud rate). The source files are
located in the gnat directory in a package named System.Text_IO
(gnat/s-textio.adb). By default

Memory Layout
-------------

The memory layout is controlled by linker scripts specific to whether the
program is located in memory. GNAT for M68020 ships with a single script named
common-RAM.ld that determines where program is loaded into memory. It is
located in the ld directory.

Script selection is controlled by a scenario variable declared in an XML
file named runtime.xml that is located in the runtime root directory. The
scenario variable is used to specify linker switches.

The memory sections' locations and sizes are specified in memory-map.ld,
also located in the ld directory. The XML also specifies this file as part
of the linker switches.

You can modify all of these scripts as required. Alternatively, these
scripts can be overridden at link time by setting the environment variable
LOADER to 'USER' and specifying the linker script via the '-T' linker switch.

Serial Port
-----------

Ada.Text_IO uses the USART peripheral contained within MC68901 Mutlifuntion
Peripheral for serial communication (with the MC68901 located at address
16#FFF8_0000#). The USART is configured for 9600 baud, 8-bit characters, with
no start, stop bits, or parity bits.

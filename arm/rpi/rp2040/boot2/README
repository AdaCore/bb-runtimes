This directory contains the source code and precompiled files for the RP2040
stage 2 bootloader (boot2). The boot2 is loaded by the RP2040 bootrom after
reset from the first 256 bytes of flash memory into RAM, where it is then
executed after checking its CRC-32 (the last 4 bytes). Boot2 is responsible
for configuring the QSPI flash memory for eXecute In Place (XIP) operation
and then jumping to the main application.

The following boot2 variants are supported:

generic_03
,,,,,,,,,,
The generic_03 boot2 is compatible with any flash chip that supports the
03h read command (which is most serial NOR flash devices). The downside is
that it operates in standard SPI mode so is about 3x slower than QSPI.

generic_qspi
,,,,,,,,,,,,
The generic_qspi boot2 is compatible with most (but not all) QSPI NOR
flash chips. It is compatible with at least the following flash chips:
* AT25SF128A
* GD25Q64C
* IS25LP128F
* W25Q16JV
* W25Q32JV
* W25Q64JV
* W25Q128JV

In general, it should be compatible with any devices that meet the
following requirements:
* The "Fast Read Quad I/O" (EBh) command is supported.
* The "Fast Read Quad I/O" instruction has 4 dummy cycles between
  the mode bits (M7-M0) and the first output data from the flash.
* "Continuous read" mode is supported with mode bits (M7-M0) = A0h
* The "Read JEDEC ID" (9Fh) command is supported.
* The "Write Enable" (06h) command is supported.
* If the JEDEC manufacturer ID = 9Dh (ISSI devices), then the
  "Quad Enable" (QE) flag is in bit 2 of Status Register 1
  and the "Write Status Register 1" (01h) command is supported.
* If the JEDEC manufacturer ID /= 9Dh, then QE flag is in
  bit 6 of Status Register 2 and the "Write Status Register 2" (31h)
  instruction is supported.
  
Note that this version is NOT compatible with older Winbond devices,
such as the W2580DV. Those devices MUST use the w25qxx variant of boot2.

w25qxx
,,,,,,
The w25qxx boot2 is compatible with Winbond devices that have the
QE flag in bit 6 of Status Register 2, and support writing to it
via a "continuous write" from Status Register 1. It is compatible
with at least the following Winbond devices:
* W2580DV
* W25Q16JV
* W25Q32JV
* W25Q64JV
* W25Q128JV

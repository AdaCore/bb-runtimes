Microsemi CoreCortexM1 Runtimes
================================

This BSP supports the Microsemi CoreCortexM1 v2.0 and v3.0 processors for the
Microsemi PolarFire and RTG4 FPGA families.


Required IP
----------

* CoreCortexM1
* CoreUARTapb (for Ada.Text_IO)


Runtimes Supported
------------------

* ZFP
* Ravenscar-SFP
* Ravenscar-Full


Using the BSP
-------------

To install the Microsemi CoreCortexM1 runtimes first ensure that the GNAT Pro
arm-elf compiler is on your path. The Ravenscar-SFP runtime can then be
installed through the following commands:

$ cd BSPs
$ gprbuild -j0 -P ravenscar_sfp_microsemi_m1.gpr
$ gprinstall -p -P ravenscar_sfp_microsemi_m1.gpr

The other runtimes can be installed by specifying the corresponding project
file within the BSPs directory. The runtime can then be used by your
application by:

* selecting the runtime in GPS through the project properties dialog;
* adding the ``for Runtime ("ada") use "ravenscar-sfp-microsemi-m1";``
  attribute to your project file; or
* passing the ``--RTS=ravenscar-sfp-microsemi-m1`` switch to gprbuild.


Resources Used
--------------

The Ravenscar runtimes use the SysTick interrupt to implement Ada semantics for
time, i.e., delay statements and package Ada.Real_Time. The SysTick interrupt
handler runs at highest priority. Additionally, the PendSV and SVCall
interrupts are reserved for runtime use.

Ada.Text_IO on the the Microsemi CoreCortexM1 runtimes is configured to
utilise the Microsemi CoreUARTapb IP at an address of 16#4200_0000#. The
CoreUARTapb memory address can be changed by updating the CoreUARTapb_Base
constant in BSPs/cortex-m/microsemi-m1/src/crt0/i-microsemi.ads prior to
building the runtime.


Memory Layout
-------------

The Microsemi CoreCortexM1 is configured for the following memory space:

  FPGA SRAM - ORIGIN: 0x00000000, SIZE: 128KB
  ITCM -      ORIGIN: 0x10000000, SIZE: 64KB
  DTCM -      ORIGIN: 0x20000000, SIZE: 64KB

The size of each region can be modified by updating
BSPs/cortex-m/microsemi-m1/link/memory-map.ld. For example, if you are using
the CoreCortexM1 v3.0 you may wish to increase the ITCM and DTCM sizes to
128KB to account for the RAM available on this core.

Two loader options are provided: TCM (default) and RAM. The RAM loader stores
and runs the program out of SRAM at the memory address 0x0. The TCM loader on
the other hand stores the program in SRAM, and at startup loads the text
section of the program into the ITCM and data sections into DTCM. Once the
data has been copied, the TCM loader will remap the ITCM region to
16#00000000# to execute the program out of the ITCM. The loader can be chosen
by providing the -XLOADER switch to GPRbuild.


System Clock
------------

The Microsemi CoreCortexM1 runtime is configured for a 50MHz clock. If your
CoreCortexM1 is provided with a different clock rate, update the
Clock_Frequency constant in BSPs/cortex-m/microsemi-m1/src/crt0/s-bbbopa.ads
before building either Ravenscar runtime.


Interrupts
----------

The Microsemi CoreCortexM1 runtime supports 32 IRQ interrupts. Interrupt
priority are not supported by the Ravenscar runtimes. The interrupt names are
located in Ada.Interrupts.Names (a-intnam.ads).


Serial Port
-----------

The Microsemi CoreCortexM1 runtime libraries provide a minimal version of
package Ada.Text_IO supporting character and string-based input and output
routines through the CoreUARTapb IP core. The device is configured for
115200 baudrate, 8-bit data, 1 stop bit and no parity. The System.Text_IO
package (BSPs/cortex-m/microsemi-m1/src/crt0/s-textio.adb) may be modified
if a different configuration is desired.

If Ada.Text_IO is not used the user is free to use the CoreUARTapb device.

Zynq Runtimes
-------------

Runtimes Supported

   ZFP
   Ravenscar-SFP
   Ravenscar-Full

Targets Supported

   Xilinx ZC702 REV 1.0, dual-core Cortex-A9

   The two main documents are:

      [TRM] ug585-Zynq-7000-TRM.pdf (The technical Reference Manual)
      [EBD] ug850-zc702-eval-bd.pdf (Evaluation Board User Guide)

System Clocks

   See package System.BB.Parameters (s-bbpara-cortexa9.ads) in the gnat repository for the clock frequency declaration. According to [EBD], PS_CLK is set to 33.333333 Mhz.

   Note that there are two different version so package System, one each for the ravenscar-full and ravenscar-sfp runtimes: system-xi-cortexa-full.ads, and system-xi-cortexa-sfp.ads, respectively.

Startup Code

   There is one assembly language files for the startup code: start-ram.S.

   For the ZFP runtime the crt0.S file is used to initialize the vector table. For the ravenscar-* runtimes, the code in package System.BB.CPU_Primitives (gnat/s-bbcppr-arm.adb) then installs GNAT-specific handlers that raise exceptions for the traps.

   Booting

      The simplest way is to use u-boot (in flash) and then download via
      ethernet:
      > set ipaddr x.x.x.x
      > nfs 0x10000000 y.y.y.y:/path/to/file
      > bootelf 0x10000000

      U-Boot settings:

         ARM_PLL: PLL_FDIV=40
         DDR_PLL: PLL_FDIV=32 (1066Mhz)
         IO_PLL:  PLL_FDIV=30

         ARM_CLK: DIVISOR=2, SRCSEL=ARM_PLL   -> 666.6 Mhz
         DDR_CLK: 2XCLK_DIVISOR=3, 3XCLK_DIVISOR=2
         DCI_CLK: DIVISOR1=3, DIVISOR0=35
         APER_CLK: DMA,USB0,USB1,GEM0,SDIO0,CAN0,I2C0,I2C1,UART1,GPIO,LQSPI,SMC
         SDIO_CLK: DIVISOR=20, SRCSEL=IO_PLL, CLKACT0=EN (50Mhz)
         UART_CLK: DIVISOR=20, SRCSEL=IO_PLL, CLKACT1=EN (50Mhz)

Interrupts

   The package Ada.Interrupts.Names is located in the gnat repository (a-intnam-xi-zynq.ads) and is renamed accordingly during packaging.

   See the package body for System.BB.Board_Support (s-bbbosu-cortexa9.adb) in the gnat repository for board configuration for interrupts.

Memory Layout

   See memmap.xml for the memory map used. There is also one linker script, ram.ld.

Resources Used

   The Ravenscar runtime libraries use CPU_Private_Timer_Interrupt interrupt to implement Ada semantics for time, i.e., delay statements and package Ada.Real_Time.  See the package body for System.BB.Board_Support in the tailored file s-bbbosu-cortexa9.adb.

   The runtime libraries provide a minimal version of package Ada.Text_IO supporting character- and string-based input and output routines. The bodies of the Ada.Text_IO routines call through to a device-specific I/O package named System.Text_IO. Different architectures and different variants of a given board are represented by distinct versions of the package body for this package. This target is supported by the file s-textio-zynq.adb in the gnat repository. The default console is available via USB, 115200 Baud 8N1 from UART-1. (Baud_rate_gen=20Mhz/86  baud_rate=20Mhz/86/(4+1)=116279). You can change the baud rate etc. in that package.

   --  Use a fairly high scaling factor so that Ada.Real_Time.Time_Unit is
   --  at least 1 microsecond. This improves the long-running accuracy of
   --  periodic tasks where the period is not integer divisible by 32.768 kHz.
   --
   --  The maximum permitted scaling factor is 255, otherwise the 24-bit RTC
   --  period (@ 32 kHz) cannot be scaled to the 32-bit range of
   --  Timer_Interval.

   Main_Clock_Frequency : constant := 32_768 * RTC_Tick_Scaling_Factor;
   --  On the nRF52 we use the RTC peripheral as the system tick, instead of
   --  the Cortex-M4 SysTick because the SysTick is powered down when the CPU
   --  enters sleep mode (via the "wfi" instruction). Since we still want to
   --  be able to put the CPU to sleep (to save power) we instead use the
   --  low-power RTC peripheral, which runs at 32.768 kHz.
   --
   --  In this runtime, the minimum allowed frequency is 50_000 Hz so that
   --  Ada.Real_Time.Time_Unit does not exceed 20 us as required by
   --  Ada RM D.8 (30). Since the RTC's actual period is 30.518 us we multiply
   --  the RTC frequency by RTC_Tick_Scaling_Factor so that Time_Unit meets the
   --  requirement in Ada RM D.8 (30).

Xilinx ZynqMP Cortex-R5 runtime
===============================

Runtimes Supported
------------------

* Light
* Light-Tasking
* Embedded

Targets Supported
-----------------

* Xilinx ZynqMP ARM Cortex-R5[0] in split mode

Resources used by the runtime:
------------------------------

- The GIC is configured to redirect the exceptions to the Ada runtime.
- The UART0 is used as standard input/output by the runtime.
- The timers TTC0[0] and TTC0[1] are used to support clock and timing events,
  the corresponding interrupts (68, 69) are thus reserved for runtime usage.

The timing assumes that the LPD_APB_CLK frequency is 100MHz, and configures
the TTC0 prescalers so that the counter frequency is 12.5MHz. See s-bbpara.ads
if this needs to be changed.

The interrupts TTC0_0_Interrupt and TTC0_1_Interrupt are reserved by this
runtime, so should not be used in user code.

Boot:
-----

Only booting from RAM is currently supported, with the entry point set to
0x0.

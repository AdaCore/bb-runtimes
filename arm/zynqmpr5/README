Xilinx ZynqMP Cortex-R5 runtime
===============================

Runtimes Supported
------------------

* ZFP
* Ravenscar-SFP
* Ravenscar-Full

Targets Supported
-----------------

* Xilinx ZynqMP ARM Cortex-R5

Resources used by the runtime:
------------------------------

- The GIC is configured to redirect the exceptions to the Ada runtime.
- The UART0 is used as standard input/output by the runtime.
- The timers TTC0[0] and TTC0[1] are used to support clock and timing events,
  the corresponding interrupts (68, 69) are thus reserved for runtime usage.

The timing assumes that the LPD_APB_CLK frequency is 100MHz, and configures
the TTC0 prescalers so that the counter frequency is 1.5625MHz. See
s-bbpara.ads if this needs to be changed.

The interrupts TTC0_0_Interrupt and TTC0_1_Interrupt are reserved by this
runtime, so should not be used in user code.

Boot:
-----

Only booting from RAM is currently supported, with the entry point set to
0x0.

The application installs the trap vector in the ATCM at address 0x0,
while the rest of the code and data is installed in the DDR.

Please see:
* memmap.ld: the various memory definitions, depend on the actual board.
* ram.ld: assignment from board regions to linker memory regions (boot, code,
  data).
* common.ld: the actual linker script.

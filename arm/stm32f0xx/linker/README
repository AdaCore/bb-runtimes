# linker scripts

This directory stores linker scripts for all combinations of memory sizes
for the STM32F0 family. The scripts are organised into subdirectories
based on the combinations of possible memory sizes. For example, the
linker script for a STM32F0 with 128K flash and 16K RAM is located under
`linker/flash128k/ram16k/memory-map.ld`.

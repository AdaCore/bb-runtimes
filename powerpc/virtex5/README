Virtex-5 FXT PPC440 Runtimes
============================

Runtimes Supported
------------------

* Light
* Light-Tasking
* Embedded

Target Support
--------------

Xilinx Virtex-5 FXT PowerPC 440 (single core) with FPU

The runtime does not support FPU-less systems.

The runtime uses the following FPGA IP:

* XPS Interrupt Controller at address 16#8180_0000#
* XPS 16550 UART at address 16#83E0_0000#

If these IPs are located at different memory addresses on your system, the
runtime can be updated as described in the relevant sections below.
Additionally, the runtime can be modified to support alternate UART or
Interrupt Controllers. Refer to the Interrupts and Text_IO sections below for
more details.

Using the runtimes
------------------

To use the runtime, copy them to the `<powerpc gnat install>/powerpc-elf/lib/gnat/`
folder. You can then select the runtime from the Toolchain pane of the Project
Properties dialog box in GPS or set the following in your GPR file:

   for Runtime ("ada") use "ravenscar-sfp-virtex5";

Alternatively, you can locate the runtime in another directory and then in the
project file provide the full or relative path from the project file:

   for Runtime ("ada") use "/path/to/runtime/ravenscar-sfp-virtex5";


Rebuilding the Runtime
----------------------

If you need to make changes to the runtime at any point to make changes to the
runtime's BSP you can rebuild it as follows:

For Light: gprbuild -P runtime_build.gpr -j0

For the Tasking and Embedded runtimes: gprbuild -P ravenscar_build.gpr -j0

System Clocks
-------------

See package System.BB.Board_Parameters (`s-bbbopa.ads`) in the gnat directory
for the clock frequency declaration. By default, the clock rate is set to
125MHz and can be modified by updating System.BB.Board_Parameters and
rebuilding the runtime. System.BB.Board_Parameters also defines the PLB clock
rate which is used by the runtime to determine the correct divisor for the
UART controller.

Startup Code
------------

The Xilinx Virtex-5 FXT PowerPC 440 runtime is designed to be loaded to and run
from RAM by a bootloader. As shipped, the runtime comes with two assembly files
containing the runtime startup code: `start.S` and `setup.S`. `start.S`
provides the entry of the runtime (_start_ram) that needs to be called by your
bootloader. The runtime is designed to return to the bootloader if your program
terminates. The return is performed via a blr instruction, so ensure _start_ram
is called in such a way that the link and stack registers contain the
appropriate return values at the start of _start_ram. If required, `start.S`
can be replaced with your own code.

`setup.S` provides the low-level setup that needs to be performed before the
high-level Ada code is called. This includes clearing the bss segments and
enabling and configuring the FPU. Like `start.S`, this code may be replaced
with your own code, but please contact AdaCore if you need to modify the FPU
settings as doing so may affect the conformance of the runtime to the Ada
Standard.

Memory Layout
-------------

The memory layout is controlled by the linker script `ram.ld`, which can be
found inside the ld directory. By default, the script configures the system for
128 MiB of RAM and loads the application starting from 16#10_0000# to provide
space for any bootloader in the first 1MiB of RAM. If your requirements differ
from this you can either modify the `ram.ld` directly or provide your own
project-specific linker script via the `-T` linker switch and using the
`-XLOADER=USER` switch when building your application with GPRbuild.

Interrupts
----------

The Xilinx Virtex-5 FXT PowerPC 440 runtime is configured to use the Xilinx
XPS Interrupt Controller, with the base address of the controller located at
16#8180_0000#. If your controller uses a different base address, you can update
the corresponding parameter in the System.BB.Board_Parameters (`s-bbbopa.ads`)
package.

The runtime supports up to 32 external interrupts and does not support nested
interrupts due to limitations with the XPS Interrupt Controller. The package
Ada.Interrupts.Names (`a-intnam.ads`) provides the list of interrupt names and
mappings to the underlying interrupt ID. This package is located in the gnarl
directory.

If your Xilinx Virtex-5 target uses a different interrupt controller you will
need to change the System.BB.Board_Support (`s-bbbosu.adb`) package to suite
your controller. Please see that package for details on how to make the
required changes and reach out to AdaCore support for any help needed.

Of the PowerPC core interrupt, the Decrementer and External Interrupt vectors
are reserved for runtime use. Handlers for the other PowerPC core interrupts
may be attached via System.BB.CPU_Specific.Install_Exception_Handler procedure:

   procedure Install_Exception_Handler
     (Service_Routine : System.Address;
      Vector          : Vector_Id);

The Service_Routine parameter is the address of your interrupt handler routine
and takes the form of:

   GNAT_Error_Handler (Trap : Vector_Id);

For non-critical interrupts, the processor saves the CPU state, reenables the
FPU and switches the handler to use a dedicated interrupt state. By contrast,
for critical interrupts and Machine Check interrupts the processor only saves
the non-FPU state and does not reenable the FPU while the handler is running.
Critical and Machine Check interrupts are not enabled by the runtime but can
be enabled by the user after installing the appropriate interrupt handler by
setting the appropriate MSR bits.

Text_IO
-------

The runtimes provide a minimal version of the Ada.Text_IO package supporting
character- and string-based input and output routines. The bodies of the
Ada.Text_IO routines call through to a device-specific I/O package named
System.Text_IO. See the package body in the file `s-textio.adb` in the gnat
directory for more details.

By default System.Text_IO is configured to use the XPS 16550 UART at a base
address of 16#83E0_0000#. The UART is configured for 115200 baud rate, 8-bits,
no parity and 1 stop bit.

If required the based address and UART settings can be changed in the
System.Text_IO package. If your system uses a different UART controller you may
also replace System.Text_IO with your own implementation.

Resources Used
--------------

The Ravenscar runtime libraries use the time base and decrementer core
registers to implement Ada semantics for time, i.e., delay statements and
package Ada.Real_Time. See the package body for System.BB.Board_Support in the
file `gnat/s-bbsuti.adb`. Note that these registers are 32-bits wide, so
although the underlying time base value is 64-bits, the value must be read in
two separate instructions, that is, non-atomically, and then combined. This
results in the possibility of a race condition in which the upper half changes
after being read, apart from when the lower half is read. To deal with that
race condition a loop is used, but note that this requires multiple reads of
the two registers. See function Read_Clock in that package for the loop.

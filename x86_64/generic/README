x86_64 Runtimes
===============

This BSP supports x86_64 processors.


Runtimes Supported
------------------

* zfp-x86_64: Generic ZFP runtime for x86_64.


Booting
-------

The generic x86_64 runtimes are designed to be booted from a variety of
different bootloaders that can load ELF files. For example, these runtimes can
be run with GNATemulator, or with QEMU through the switch
"-device loader,file=<your_application>,cpu-num=0".

Resources Used
--------------

The runtime libraries provide a minimal version of package Ada.Text_IO
supporting character- and string-based input and output routines. These are
implemented using a board-specific UART. You can change the UART selection
as well as the configuration (e.g., the baud rate). The source files are
located in the gnat directory in a package named System.Text_IO
(gnat/s-textio.adb).

Memory Layout
-------------

The memory layout is controlled by linker scripts specific to where the
program is located in memory. GNAT for x86_64 Bare Metal ships with a single
script named common-RAM.ld that determines where program is loaded into RAM.
It is located in the ld directory.

Script selection is controlled by a scenario variable declared in an XML
file named runtime.xml that is located in the runtime root directory. The
scenario variable is used to specify linker switches.

The memory sections' locations and sizes are specified in memory-map.ld,
also located in the ld directory. The XML also specifies this file as part
of the linker switches.

You can modify all of these scripts as required. Alternatively, these
scripts can be overridden at link time by setting the environment variable
LOADER to 'USER' and specifying the linker script via the '-T' linker switch.

By default the runtimes are configured to use 128MB. If your system has more
or less memory, modify memory-map.ld to suite your requirements.

Serial Port
-----------

Ada.Text_IO uses the standard COM1 port with a the default configuration of
24000 baud, 8-bit characters, with no start, one stop bit, and no parity bits.

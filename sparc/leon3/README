Leon3 runtime
-------------

The runtime was built and tested on an UT699 compatible board using
a 40Mhz clock. You need to change the parameters if your system is different.

All the parameters are set in s-bbbopa.ads.
You need to specify:

- the clock frequency (used for delays).  An incorrect value won't result in
  a crash but will change the second definition of the runtime.

- whether or not extended interrupts are present, and if they are, their
  priorities.

- the address of the interrupt controler. It is used for timers interrupts
  and for user interrupt handlers

- the address of the timers unit.  The runtime uses timer 1 and timer 2 for
  the clock and for the delays.  The interrupt number of timer 1 is also
  specified.

- the address of the uart used by the console (and Ada.Text_IO).

- The number of CPUs.  Runtime is SMP if there are at least 2 CPUs.

Finally the package Ada.Interrupts.Names declares a name for each interrupt.
You may need to change it if your board is different.

Interrupts are not unmasked when attached, so user has to manually
unmask them.  This will also specify which CPU the interrupt is delivered to.

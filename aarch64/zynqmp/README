Ravenscar for Xilinx Ultrascale+ boards
=======================================

Main characteristics:
---------------------

This runtime supports the running on the quad cortex-A53 SMP APU block of the
UltraScale+ MPSoC.

- boot from Exception Level 3-1: the boot process is configuring the various
  EL down to 1 in 64-bit mode. The runtime mode used is EL1 non-secure.
- MMU: the mmu configuration is expecting 2GB of DDRAM and configures the
  memory access in 32-bit mode.
- SMP: the four cores are supported by the runtime in SMP mode.
- Interrupts: 16 level of interrupt priority are supported, and thus nested
  interruptions are supported as well. Finally, the use of the FPU is always
  supported, in tasks and in interrupt handlers.

Resources used by the runtime:
------------------------------

- the GIC is configured to redirect the exceptions to the Ada runtime
- the Software generated interrupt 0 is reserved by the runtime and should not
  be used by user code.
- The UART0 is used as standard input/output by the runtime.

Memory mapping:
---------------

  <!-- DDR, 2GB -->
  <region access="rwx---" cache="wb"
	  virt="0x00000000" size="0x80000000" name="ram"/>

  <!-- PL -->
  <region access="rw-rw-" cache="nc"
	  virt="0x80000000" size="0x40000000" name="pl"/>

  <!-- QSPI, lower PCIe -->
  <region access="rw-rw-" cache="nc"
	  virt="0xC0000000" size="0x20000000" name="qspi"/>

  <!-- Peripherals -->
  <region access="rw-rw-" cache="nc"
	  virt="0xF8000000" size="0x08000000" name="io"/>

Boot:
-----

For now, only boot from RAM is supported, with the entry point set to 0x00000.
